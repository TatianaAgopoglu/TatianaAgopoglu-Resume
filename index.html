        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education Assistantüçé</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am a second year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am double majoring in Sociology/ Law and Society with a minor in Education. Throughout my high school career, I have had many academic achievements and have become a part of numerous school clubs. My academic achievements include being a National Honor Society Inductee, receiving the Dean‚Äôs Award, Principal‚Äôs Honor List, Effort/Dedication Award, and Presidential Award. Along with numerous hours of studying, I would take part in extracurricular activities like being a Red Cross Volunteer, Club President,  ARS ( Relief Society) Saturday School Mentor, and a member of ‚ÄúSpoken Word Ensemble‚Äù. 
            I have had no work experience before, but have had many opportunities to intern and advance my skills. The two most memorable internships for me were my internships at a law firm and being  a teacher‚Äôs assistant. My goal is law school, hence why I was interested in interning at a law firm. As a second year student with no bachelors degree yet it is hard to find a job at a law office that is why I interned. However, it was similar to a day job because it started from eight in the morning and lasted till five in the evening. I had to look over a lot of cases and perform scanning, evaluating, and packaging. My internship after was at my elementary school. In my internship as a teacher‚Äôs assistant I looked forward to going there everyday. I was going to a classroom whose students were mostly of the four to five year range. Because I was a teacher‚Äôs assistant for the preschool and transitional kindergarten students I was looked upon as a teacher in the student‚Äôs eyes. I love going to school and being a student myself so being in a classroom environment was exciting. It was such an enjoyable experience for me that it became the reason I wanted to pursue education as a minor. Before college, it is always assumed that one is set with what they want their career to be but that has a high possibility of changing and that was the case for me. I had thought I would want to be in the medical field, but realizing my strengths, achievement, and passion I was sure to find myself as a sociology/law major who wanted to be in the law field.. These internship opportunities were eye opening because it was the reassurance I needed to know I am on the right path for myself. 
            I have various skills that have made me more qualified to even start with an internship position. One of the skills I have is being trilingual in the languages, English, Armenian, and Turkish. Another skill is that I am competent in Microsoft Word, Excel,  and PowerPoint. The law firm internship also contributed to developing a new skill which is being proficient in writing demand letters in law.<br><br>
